# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-Project-EDA

This repository contains my Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) project using Python Pandas. The project focuses on analyzing advertising dataset for area income and daily internet usage on Ad utilizing Jupyter Notebook for coding.

# Overview

The dataset used in this project comprises approximately 1001 entries. The primary objective of the analysis is to perform EDA to gain insights into Daily time spent on site, number of times clicked on Ad, Gender Distribution, Correlation and Top 5 Topic lines 

# Data Source

The dataset used for this analysis is sourced from csv file uploaded. You can find the dataset here : https://github.com/rshilpa16/EDA-Advertising/blob/main/Copy%20of%20advertising.csv

# Python Libraries Used

Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib
Seaborn

# Project Details

Data Cleaning: The initial step involves cleaning up the dataset to prepare it for analysis. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and ensuring data consistency.
Data Analysis: The focus of the analysis is on advertising data daily time spent on site, how many males and females view the Ad, how many times they clicked on Ad and relation between time spent on site and internet usage. 
Visualization: The insights derived from the data analysis are visually represented using Seaborn and other visualization libraries. This includes creating plots, charts, and graphs to effectively communicate the findings.
Conclusion: The project concludes with a summary of key insights and observations obtained from the EDA process.

# Usage

To run the Jupyter Notebook file containing the code for this analysis, simply download the ipynb file and open it in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

Feel free to explore the code and adapt it to your own analysis projects!

Note: This project is solely for educational and demonstration purposes.
